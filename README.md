# AmazonCloneBasic

A simple, static front-end clone of an Amazon-like storefront built with HTML and CSS. This project is intended as a learning exercise and a demonstration of layout, responsive styling, and asset usage (images and media).

## Demo / Preview
- Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site locally.
- A recorded demo (screen recording) is included in the repo as: `Screen Recording - Made with FlexClip.webm`.

## Features
- Static homepage layout inspired by Amazon's layout and product categories.
- Responsive-ish layout using HTML and CSS.
- Product/category images and hero banner included as assets.
- A sample product page: `PS3.html` (example product/details page).

## Files & Structure (overview)
- index.html — Main entry (homepage).
- style.css — Styling for the site.

- Multiple image assets in the repository root (e.g., `amazon_logo.png`, `Hero.jpg`, `Mobiles.jpg`, `Laptops.jpg`, etc.).

Note: images are stored in the repository root; you can organize them into an `assets/` or `images/` folder if you prefer.
